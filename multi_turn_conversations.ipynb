      "Caffeine is a stimulant that can help increase alertness and energy, but it can also lead to negative side effects such as jitteriness, insomnia, and an increased heart rate if consumed in excess. Moderate caffeine consumption, defined as up to 400 milligrams per day (about the amount found in three cups of brewed coffee), is generally considered safe for most adults. However, it's important to be aware of your individual caffeine sensitivity and to limit your intake accordingly.\n",
